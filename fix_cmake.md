# How to Fix the CMake Error

The error you're encountering is related to a mismatch between the CMake cache directory and your current project directory. This typically happens when you copy a project from one location to another or when you have multiple projects with similar structures.

## Solution 1: Manual Fix

1. **Delete the build directory**:
   - Close any running Flutter applications
   - Delete the `build/windows` directory in your project
   - Run `flutter clean` to clean all build files

2. **Regenerate the CMake files**:
   - Run `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` to ensure Windows desktop support is enabled
   - Run `flutter pub get` to get dependencies
   - Run `flutter run -d windows` to rebuild the project

## Solution 2: Create a New Project

If Solution 1 doesn't work, you can create a new Flutter project and copy your code into it:

1. **Create a new Flutter project**:
   ```
   flutter create --platforms=windows new_envirosense
   ```

2. **Copy your code**:
   - Copy the `lib` directory from your current project to the new project
   - Copy the `pubspec.yaml` file (or merge its dependencies with the new one)
   - Copy any assets or other resources

3. **Run the new project**:
   ```
   cd new_envirosense
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d windows
   ```

## Solution 3: Fix the CMake Cache Directly

If you're comfortable with CMake, you can edit the CMake cache directly:

1. **Open the CMakeCache.txt file**:
   - Navigate to `build/windows/x64/`
   - Open `CMakeCache.txt` in a text editor

2. **Update the paths**:
   - Find all instances of the old path (e.g., `C:/Users/IVI/Python Projects/CountWiseTest/mobile`)
   - Replace them with the new path (e.g., `C:/Users/IVI/Python Projects/EnviroSense/mobile`)

3. **Save and rebuild**:
   - Save the file
   - Run `flutter run -d windows`

## Preventing This Issue in the Future

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Use version control** (like Git) to manage your projects
2. **Clone repositories** instead of copying them
3. **Run `flutter clean`** before moving or copying projects

I recommend trying Solution 1 first, as it's the simplest and most reliable approach.
